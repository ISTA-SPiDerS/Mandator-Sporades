This repository implements Sporades consensus protocol and a Mandator memory pool.

Our protocol uses [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/).
It requires the ```protoc``` compiler with the ```go``` output plugin installed.


Our protocol uses [Redis](https://redis.io/topics/quickstart) and it should be installed with default options.

All implementations are tested in ```Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS```
